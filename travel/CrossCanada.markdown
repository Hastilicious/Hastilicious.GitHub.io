We kicked off our journey with a nine-hour drive from Toronto to **Lake Superior Provincial Park**, where we camped at the serene Agawa Bay South. This was our first time camping in a **rooftop tent**—a new experience that quickly grew on us, especially as we set up our tent in the wilds of northern Ontario.

- **Stay:** Agawa Bay South, site A342 – a peaceful location with stunning sunsets and the sound of waves crashing on the shore. This was a silent site meaning no loud music, or gatherings after sunset. 
- **Facilities:** Clean and well-maintained, though the bathrooms could use foot-washing stations due to sand accumulation from the beach.
- **Tip:** If you’re new to camping, I highly recommend starting with a rooftop tent—it adds a level of comfort and security that’s perfect for beginners. Oh also, pack your food.  there is nothing near by.
We stayed here until September 7, soaking in the tranquility and beauty of the park.

On September 7, we left Lake Superior and continued our journey towards **Thunder Bay**, stopping at the iconic **Terry Fox Memorial**. The emotional experience of visiting this tribute to Canada’s hero was heightened by the breathtaking views of the northern landscape.

We also made a quick stop at **Kakabeka Falls**, often called the “Niagara Falls of the North.” From there, we pressed on to **Dryden, Ontario**, where we spent the night after a long day of driving.

- **Highlight:** The scenic beauty of Lake Superior, the emotional visit to the Terry Fox Memorial, and the awe-inspiring Kakabeka Falls.
- **Travel Tip:** Plan your accommodations in advance—this stretch of highway offers few options, and last-minute bookings can be pricey. Dryden is the largest town between Winnipeg, Manitoba and Thunder Bay, Ontario.
